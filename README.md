# DERs
Code accompanying Purdue ME 597: Distributed Energy Resources (DERs),
created by Kevin J. Kircher in Spring 2024.

Course website: https://kevinjkircher.com/distributed-energy-resources/

In this course, I aim to teach students how to model, simulate, design, 
and control DERs such as batteries, electric vehicles, buildings,
heating and cooling equipment, thermal energy storage, water heaters,
and solar photovoltaics.

I'm currently writing code for the course in Matlab, but will likely
support Python and/or Julia in future semesters.

This code is open source under a permissive MIT license.
