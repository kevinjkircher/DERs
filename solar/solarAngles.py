def solar_angles(lat, long, t, offset_gmt):
    """
     solarAngles computes the sun's elevation and azimuth angles, as seen by
     an observer at the input location.

     Input arguments must be scalars or columns.

     Inputs:
       lat, the observer's latitude in degrees
       long, the observer's longitude in degrees
       t, the local datetime or array of datetimes
       offset_gmt, the time difference between local and GMT
           (for example, offset_gmt = -5 for US Eastern Time)

     Outputs:
       el, the sun's elevation angle in degrees
           convention: 0 at sunrise/sunset
       az, the sun's azimuth angle in degrees
           convention: 0 south, 90 west, +/-180 north, -90 east
